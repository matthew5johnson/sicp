Give an interpretation of the stream computed by the following procedure:

(define (expand num den radix)
  (cons-stream
     (quotient (* num radix) den)
     (expand (remainder (* num radix) den) den radix)))
     
     
Interpretation: This procedure creates a stream with the stream-car being (/ (* num radix) den), and the stream-cdr being (expand (remainder (* num radix) den) den radix) which is a recursive call to iteself. stream-cdr is constantly feeding new arguments to stream-car.
     
(quotient is a primitive that returns the integer quotient of two integers) What are the successive elements produced by (expand 1 7 10) ? What is produced by (expand 3 8 10) ?
(expand 1 7 10)
> 1
> 4
> 2
> 8

(expand 3 8 10)
> 3
> 7
> 5
> 0
> 0

Apparently these are the digits of (/ num den) in base radix. 
1/7 = 0.1428
3/8 = 0.37500
