Since the environment modulators (withdraw! and deposit!) each only have one set!, the order of processes doesn't matter.
If serialization is not used, and another user sees an incorrect balance while a withdrawal or deposit is being processed, 
they either see the beginning balance or ending balance. If they perform a withraw! or deposit! of their own, since it's only a one step
procedure anyway, they start with either the beginning or ending balance relative to the concurrent process. You'd want to start using
serializers when the number of state changes in a single process got to be above one.
