Implementing such precision seems like overkill for a simple bank account.

But, I can imagine a scenario in which it would be beneficial to protect the call to 'balance' by putting it within a serializer.
In a situation where there are multiple concurrent calls for balance, withdrawals, and deposits, serializing the call to 
balance will ensure that at least the one-off procedures indivually complete before a balance can be returned.
The setting would need to be time sensitive for such an implementation to be worth the trouble.
