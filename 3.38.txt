Peter:	(set! balance (+ balance 10))
Paul:	(set! balance (- balance 20))
Mary:	(set! balance (- balance (/ balance 2)))

a. If run sequentially in the order above, the result would be a balance of -5.
1) balance of 10 (10 deposited)
2) balance of -10 (20 withdrawn)
3) balance of -5 (5 deposited)

b. Peter's deposit would have to be first in order to avoid NSF, but either Paul or Mary could go second and third. With concurrency,
you could get a final balance ranging from -5 to -15.
