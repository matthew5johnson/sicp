Without running the program, describe the elements of the stream defined by 

(define s (cons-stream 1 (add-streams s s)))

s is a stream of 1 and (add-streams s s). 

From earlier in the chapter:
(define (add-streams s1 s2)
  (stream-map + s1 s2))
  
So in our question, (add-streams s s) is performing stream-map on the streams s and s.
This means that each time we cdr down the stream, we get a new car that's double the previous number that the stream produced.

> 1
> 2
> 4
> 8
...
