Exercise 3.40.  Give all possible values of x that can result from executing

(define x 10)

(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x (* x x)))
                  (lambda () (set! x (* x x x))))

10, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^2 ^3, 10^3 ^2  <<-- The x=10 can be put in for any single one of the x's throughout the process.


Which of these possibilities remain if we instead use serialized procedures:

(define x 10)

(define s (make-serializer))

(parallel-execute (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x))))
                  (s (lambda () (set! x (* x x x)))))
                  
A serializer prevents the output of one of the parallel processes from feeding in as an input to another parallel process. So serializing
these two will restrict our outcomes to just 10^2 ^3.
