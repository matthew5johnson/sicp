 The proposed squarer:
 (define (squarer a b)
   (multiplier a a b))
   
 Flaw: It's unidirectional. It can only go in the direction of being given a first and then calculating b. 
 To be a constraint device with two terminals, it would need to function given b as the first argument as well, and it doesn't.
